A simple sketch that incorporates some business logic to the [SonicDiscReader](../../SonicDiscReader) example and makes a [Smartcar](http://plat.is/smartcar) rotate until it is facing a detected obstacle using the SonicDisc.

The described behavior can be seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGXUQHS0aXI).
